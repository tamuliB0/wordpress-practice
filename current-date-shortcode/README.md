# Date shortcode
In this plugin, I learned about what is a shortcode. Shortcode is a custom code snippet that may contain message in any form

I had to learn about [add_shortcode](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/add_shortcode/)

# How to use
In any post/page, use the shortcode [current_date]

# What would be displayed to users
The shortcode is replaced with the current date and time in readable format (e.g., October 6, 2025 08:33 PM).
