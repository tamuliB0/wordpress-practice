# Dynamic shortcode
In this plugin, I learned how to create personalized content based on user status.

I had to learn about 
[is_user_logged_in](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/is_user_logged_in/)and 
[wp_get_current_user](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_get_current_user/) 
to personalize the greeting.

# How to use
In any post/page, use the shortcode [greeting] to display a personalized greeting.

# What would be displayed to users
Logged-in users see "Hello, [their name]". Guests see "Hello, Guest".
