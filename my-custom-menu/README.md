# My Custom Admin Page
In this plugin, I learned how to create custom admin pages in WordPress.

I had to learn about add_menu_page to add a custom menu item to the admin dashboard.


# What would be displayed to users
Administrators see a new "Custom Admin" menu item in the dashboard. Clicking it shows a simple welcome page with a heading and paragraph.
