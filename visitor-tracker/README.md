# Visitor tracker
In this plugin, I learned how to track website visitors and store their information.
I had to learn about register_activation_hook for database setup, wp_loaded for tracking visitors, and add_menu_page to create an admin interface.


# What would be displayed to users
No frontend display. In the admin dashboard, administrators can view a log of the last 100 visitors with their IP addresses, browser information, and visit times.
