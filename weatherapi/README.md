# weather-api
I learned about weather details retrieval through [weatherapi](https://www.weatherapi.com/). Also, learned [shortcode-atts](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/shortcode_atts/).


## what it does 
This plugin works as a shortcode, fetches weather details with Rest API from weatherapi.com
